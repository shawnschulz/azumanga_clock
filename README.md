# azumanga_clock
a retro azumanga daioh clock widget for i3 gtk

install the prereq modules:

```
pip install gi.repository
```

then simply run:

```
python3 azumanga_clock.py
```

you can configure your system to run it on startup as needed. i have no clue if this works on systems that aren't running gtk. i use it with i3, so the widget is opened a little above where the task bar would be !
